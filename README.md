# draggable-canvas

A tiny little canvas where you can create texts with variable font size and variable colors and you can reposition those texts to whatever part of the canvas you like.

This is the kind of project that is always going to be in WIP state since there are so many things that can be plugged in. So, if you run into any bugs or have any idea to change the UX or add a feature, feel free to open an issue.

## Motivation

I'm a big music fan and during college days, during boring lectures, I would always write song lyrics at the back of my notebook that really resonated with me (I am a big fan of emo music, HMU MCR fans).

I am now no longer a college student, and now I know a bit of React and JS and one fine day I thought hey, let me make a cool word cloud of all such lyrics that truly resonated during the quarantine. But obviously, I didn't want to use any existing tool like photoshop or any online tool and so I thought of making a small webpage myself that would allow me to write different pieces of lyrics with different font sizes and colors. So, I made this tiny little canvas.
